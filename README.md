# Openssl

Basically, We use RSA encryption mechanism, and the public/private key
must be named as "public.key", "private.key".

You must create "plain.txt" first, run the program, and "encrypt.txt" will be generated.

We also provide "decrypt.txt" to validate the correctness of encrypt/decrypt procedure.
